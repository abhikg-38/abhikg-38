Hello! I'm Abhik and I'm currently a college student pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I have a strong academic interest in the fields of machine learning and data science. I've worked on a spread of projects relating to this domain and look forward to diving deeper into deep learning models and data science. What I'm also interested in is the deployment of these models to tackle relevant real world problems. I'd love to explore opportunities that would allow me expand my knowledge in anything related to project development and deployment. Here's to learning more!
