Hello! I'm Abhik and I'm currently a  college student pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I have a strong academic interest in the fields of software development, machine learning and data science. I've worked on a spread of projects relating to these domains and look forward to diving deeper into the varied world of software dev. I've been working on expanding my proficiency in use of web frameworks like NodeJS,Express, ReactJS, Flask and to further my understanding of server side operations, user authentication systems and  database interactions. What I'm also interested in is the deployment of these applications to tackle relevant real world problems. I'd love to explore opportunities that would allow me expand my knowledge in anything related to project development and deployment. Here's to learning more!
